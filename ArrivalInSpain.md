# Your arrival in Spain: getting through the administrative maze

Welcome to Spain, and more particularly to our group. Even if Spanish people are
generally warm and welcoming, it is sometimes hard for newcomers, especially the
non-spanish-speakers, to find their way through all the administrative steps in
order to settle down easily. These small guidelines will give you an overview of
the process, that can be quite time-(and patience)- consuming. We will focus
mostly on how to get to signing your contract. In any case you should go to the
[Servicio de Acogida para los Extranjeros](http://www.uam.es/ss/Satellite/es/1242652242790/subHomeServicio/Oficina_de_Acogida.htm)
on Plaza Mayor at the UAM: it is their job to walk you through your arrival.
They may even pinpoint you the points mentioned here that are outdated or even
(but hopefully not) wrong. Note that all the links provided in this document
suppose that you’ll choose to live in Madrid city, and they are in Spanish.

## Before landing in Spain

If you are not from the European Union (E.U.), you should have asked for **a
working and residence visa**, which should come along **a working permit**.
Also, the university must have issued a **pre-contract**. Also, prepare a copy
of your latest **academic degree** (especially your PhD if you are coming for a
post-doc). If you are from the E.U, get your **pre-contract** and
your **academic degree**.

Note that you can plan a little ahead, and take in advance the appointments
online for the **empadronamiento** and especially the **NIE** that takes a while
to get. See the related sections for the necessary documents to bring in.

## The hurdles towards the contract:

### Not a E.U. resident

If you are from outside the E.U, things are going to be easier for you, since
with your visa came the **N.I.E** (ID number for foreigners), which is written
on your visa. In that case, you will have to get, mostly in that order:

- **Rental Contract**: You should find a flat as soon as possible. You will need
a rental contract to prove you have somewhere you live. The copy of your
pre-contract should help with landlords. I did not have to show anything else to
find a flat, but I would not consider my experience statistically relevant. If
you need some time to find a flat and feel pressed to have your contract
running, for the first next steps you can rely solely on a certificate from your
temporary housing (university residence, air Bnb, friend that is housing you),
depending on your negotiation skills.

- **Empadronamiento**: This is a certificate delivered by your **cityhall**
(*Ayuntamiento*). Look for the [Oficina de Atencion al Ciudadano](http://www.madrid.es/portales/munimadrid/es/Inicio/El-Ayuntamiento/Atencion-al-ciudadano/Oficinas-de-Atencion-al-Ciudadano?vgnextfmt=default&vgnextchannel=5b99cde2e09a4310VgnVCM1000000b205a0aRCRD).
Warning, Madrid (*Comunidad de Madrid*) is also a region but it is a different
administration. They have similar offices, but they can’t help you. In Madrid
you have to ask for an appointment, you can do it online. This certificate
recognizes officially that your address is yours. If you get one with a
temporary address, you will need to redo this step (and the following) when you
have a permanent one. Bring a copy of your passport, your rental contract (or
substitute), and your work pre-contract.

- **Social Security Number**: With the empadronamiento, you can go to your local
[Oficina Tesoreria de la Seguridad Social](http://www.seg-social.es/Internet_1/Oficinas/BuscadordeCercanos/index.htm?Cercanos=1),
to get your social security number. You will be registered in the system, but
not yet effectively covered (see the section After the contract). Your NIE and
social security numbers will be linked already.

- **Bank account**: With your pre-contract, go to Plaza Mayor at the UAM and
open a bank account (it is a standard procedure). Unless you already have your
NIE card, they should open it under your passport number. Indeed, the university
needs to put the salary on a Spanish account.

- **Contract**: You are almost there, the human resources in the *Rectorado*
building need your NIE and social security numbers, copy of latest academic
degree, bank account number and information form.

- **NIE**: Even if you got to Spain with your NIE number, you will need to get
an appointment at the [Oficina de Extranjeria](http://www.seap.minhap.gob.es/es/ministerio/delegaciones_gobierno/delegaciones/madrid/extranjeria.html)
(depends on the police) to get your NIE card. You will have to bring your
pre-contract (or contract), photocopy of passport, and a specific form, and a
receipt for taxes that you can pay at any bank. The appointment can take a while
to get, but you should be able to do most of the steps without your card.

### E.U. resident

If you are a resident of the European Union, you do not need a visa and working
permit to get to Spain. However, after you arrival it is maybe more detrimental
that anything else, since you arrive without NIE. You basically have to follow
the same steps as the non E.U. residents, with your national ID or passport
number first, and then redo them with your NIE. Or you got the NIE appointment
in advance (while you were not in Spain yet), and you will need to go through
the process (Social Security and bank) only once. Keep in mind that the work
contract cannot be finalized without your NIE. No interference with the
empadronamiento.

## After the contract

Now that the contract is finalized and you are actually getting paid, you are
almost out of the maze.

- **With your permanent address**: If you did the previous steps (starting from
empadronamiento) with a temporary address, you need to get back to doing the
empadronamiento, social security, NIE and bank account with your permanent
address.

- **With the NIE**: If you opened a bank account without your NIE, go back to
Plaza Mayor and update your contract. Same thing for the Social Security.

- **Social security**: Go to the nearest health center (it should be the one you
are affiliated with, now that you have a permanent address), bring along your
social security number and a certificate given to you by the university once the
contract has been signed. You will get there your social security card and be
effectively covered. If you brought your family with you, this is when they will
enter the system.

- **UAM account**: To get an official access to the university services, within
a few days of your contract you should get a UAM account, that comes with a mail
address and intranet access. With it you will be able to ask for a permanent IP
address at the *servicio de atencion al usuario*, which is next to
the *Politecnica* building. Meanwhile, ask Stefan Bilan (the IT guy for the
department) for a temporary one.

- **Miscellaneous**: Don’t forget to get an insurance for your flat (this is
mandatory in Spain).

**Good luck, and keep steady!**
