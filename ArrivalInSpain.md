# Your arrival in Spain: getting through the administrative maze

Welcome to Spain, and more particularly to our group. Even if Spanish people are
generally warm and welcoming, it is sometimes hard for newcomers, especially the
non-spanish-speakers, to find their way through all the administrative steps in
order to settle down easily. These small guidelines will give you an overview of
the process, that can be quite time-(and patience)- consuming. They were originally 
prepared by Alex Delga and have since been updated by various group members based
on their experiences and changing procedures.

We will focus mostly on how to get to signing your contract. In any case you should contact the
[Oficina de Acogida Internacional](https://www.uam.es/uam/en/internacional/oficina-acogida-internacional)
in Plaza Mayor at UAM: it is their job to walk you through your arrival.
They may even pinpoint you the points mentioned here that are outdated or even
(but hopefully not) wrong. Note that all the links provided in this document
suppose that you’ll choose to live in Madrid city, and they are in Spanish.

## Before landing in Spain

If you are not from the European Union (E.U.), you should have asked for **a
working and residence visa**, which should come along **a working permit**.
Also, the university must have issued a **pre-contract**. Also, prepare a copy
of your latest **academic degree** (especially your PhD if you are coming for a
post-doc). If you are from the E.U, get your **pre-contract** and
your **academic degree**.

Note that you can plan a little ahead, and take in advance the appointments
online for the **empadronamiento** and especially the **NIE** that takes a while
to get. See the related sections for the necessary documents to bring in.

## The hurdles towards the contract:

### Not a E.U. resident

If you are from outside the E.U, things are going to be easier for you, since
with your visa came the **N.I.E** (ID number for foreigners), which is written
on your visa. In that case, you will have to get, mostly in that order:

-**Spanish Mobile Number**: Absolutely needed to reserve the appointments at the offices and widely preferred to sign papers.
I suggest to get a low-budget prepaid SIM card, as for a Mobile Contract you will need the NIE.
Not all the Mobile Services will do it without the NIE, I could achieve it with the passport at Vodafone-ES.


- **Rental Contract**: You should find a flat as soon as possible. You will need
a rental contract to prove you have somewhere you live. The copy of your
pre-contract should help with landlords. I did not have to show anything else to
find a flat, but I would not consider my experience statistically relevant. If
you need some time to find a flat and feel pressed to have your contract
running, for the first next steps you can rely solely on a certificate from your
temporary housing (university residence, air Bnb, friend that is housing you),
depending on your negotiation skills.

- **Empadronamiento**: This is a certificate delivered by your **cityhall**
(*Ayuntamiento*). Look for the [Oficina de Atencion al Ciudadano](http://www.madrid.es/portales/munimadrid/es/Inicio/El-Ayuntamiento/Atencion-al-ciudadano/Oficinas-de-Atencion-al-Ciudadano?vgnextfmt=default&vgnextchannel=5b99cde2e09a4310VgnVCM1000000b205a0aRCRD).
Warning, Madrid (*Comunidad de Madrid*) is also a region but it is a different
administration. They have similar offices, but they can’t help you. In Madrid
you have to ask for an appointment, you can do it online. This certificate
recognizes officially that your address is yours. If you get one with a
temporary address, you will need to redo this step (and the following) when you
have a permanent one. Bring a copy of your passport, your rental contract (or
substitute), and your work pre-contract.  
**UPDATE COVID-19**: In Madrid you have to ask for an appointment, you can do it online.
This certificate recognizes officially that your address is yours.
If you get one with a temporary address, you will need to redo this step (and the following) when you have a permanent one.
Bring a copy of your passport, your rental contract (or substitute), and your work pre-contract.

The voice for the reservation is PADRON if you are not yet subscribed at the Ayuntamiento.
The voice Certificado de Empadronamiento is correct only if you have already done the first visit (It will be required later, After the contract section).

- **Social Security Number**: With the empadronamiento, you can go to your local
[Oficina Tesoreria de la Seguridad Social](http://www.seg-social.es/Internet_1/Oficinas/BuscadordeCercanos/index.htm?Cercanos=1),
to get your social security number. You will be registered in the system, but
not yet effectively covered (see the section After the contract). Your NIE and
social security numbers will be linked already.  
**UPDATE COVID-19**: The Oficina Tesoreria de la Seguridad Social processeses everything online due to COVID-19 restriction.
Since the time they process your request is highly variable, I strongly suggest to contact directly the Seccion de Contrattacion Personal Investigador at the UAM
and ask them to process the request of the social security number. In my experience it was quite effective and I obtained it in few days.
Through the request of the social security number, you will be registered in the system, but not yet effectively covered (see the section After the contract).
Your NIE and social security numbers will be linked already.

- **Bank account**: With your pre-contract, go to Plaza Mayor at the UAM and
open a bank account (it is a standard procedure). Unless you already have your
NIE card, they should open it under your passport number. Indeed, the university
needs to put the salary on a Spanish account.

- **Contract**: You are almost there, the human resources in the *Rectorado*
building need your NIE and social security numbers, copy of latest academic
degree, bank account number and information form.

- **NIE**: Even if you got to Spain with your NIE number, you will need to get
an appointment at the [Oficina de Extranjeria](http://www.seap.minhap.gob.es/es/ministerio/delegaciones_gobierno/delegaciones/madrid/extranjeria.html)
(depends on the police) to get your NIE card. You will have to bring your
pre-contract (or contract), photocopy of passport, and a specific form, and a
receipt for taxes that you can pay at any bank. The appointment can take a while
to get, but you should be able to do most of the steps without your card.
HOWEVER, even without completing this step you will be able to request all the other documents.  
**UPDATE-COVID19**: the appointment at the Extranjeria may take even more time to get.
Connect at the page: https://sede.administracionespublicas.gob.es/pagina/index/directorio/icpplus
If there are appointments available, the system will ask to select the office and the date.
To finalize your reservation you need a Spanish Mobile Number.
It is common not being able to obtain it the first time and the systems are overwhelmed due to COVID-19.
Keep trying every few hours to obtain it.
You need to finalize your NIE as soon as possible, although you can do it only wonce you possess all the required documentation.

### E.U. resident

If you are a resident of the European Union, you do not need a visa and working permit to get to Spain.
However, after your arrival it is maybe more detrimental than anything else, since you arrive without NIE.
Hence, the documents in this section are presented as the optimal order get everything on track.
Or you got the NIE appointment in advance (while you were not in Spain yet), and you will need to go through the process (Social Security and bank) only once.
Keep in mind that the work contract cannot be finalized without your NIE. No interference with the empadronamiento.

-**Quick note - Update COVID-19**: For signing the work contract you need NIE, Social Security Number, and a Spanish bank account. The Social Security Number and a Spanish bank account can be obtained with your NIE, passport, rental pre(contract), and work precontract. The passport is needed to get the NIE and to reserve the appointments online. While it would not be in normal condition, all the websites to reserve the appointments require the DNI/NIE/PASSPORT number.

-**Spanish Mobile Number**: Absolutely needed to reserve the appointments at the offices and widely preferred to sign papers.
I suggest to get a low-budget prepaid SIM card, as for a Mobile Contract you will need the NIE.
Not all the Mobile Services will do it without the NIE, I could achieve it with the passport at Vodafone-ES.

-**Rental Contract**: You should find a flat as soon as possible. You will need a rental contract to prove you have somewhere you live.
The copy of your pre-contract should help with landlords.
If you need some time to find a flat and feel pressed to have your contract running,
for the first next steps you can rely solely on a certificate from your temporary housing (university residence, air Bnb, friend that is housing you),
depending on your negotiation skills.
You can sign it with your passport.

-**NIE**: The most frustrating and necessary part of all of it.
You will need to get an appointment at the Oficina de Extranjeria (depends on the police) to get your NIE card.
You will have to bring your work precontract, rental (pre)contract, passport, the EX 18 form filled in, and a receipt for taxes (tasa 790 codigo 12, can be paid cash at any bank).
The appointment can take a while to get, but you should be able to do most of the steps without your card.
PLEASE BEAR IN MIND TO BRING ORIGINAL AND COPY OF EVERY DOCUMENT. 
**UPDATE-COVID19**: the appointment at the Extranjeria may take even more time to get.

Select "Madrid" in the drop-down menu

"CERTIFICADO DE REGISTRO"  
Register with the passport  
"Solicitar Cita"  
If there are appointments available, the system will ask to select the office and the date.
To finalize your reservation you need a Spanish Mobile Number just for the authentication process. If you don't have a Spanish mobile number, you can freely ask any group member to provide you with theirs.
It is common not being able to obtain it the first time and the systems are overwhelmed due to COVID-19.
Keep trying every few hours to obtain it as it is mandatory.

Once you get to the police with all required documents (original and copied versions), they will assign you the NIE on a temporary paper and they will reserve a second appointment to deliver your signed contract and the social security form. Upon delivery of the required documentation, 
you will be awarded with your NIE card (5-years work permit). UPDATE COVID-19: They may assign you the permanent NIE (green) card and thus the second appointment is not required.
I would suggest taking the second appointment a couple of weeks after your first one as the Social Security Number may take a while.
Note: Although the white paper they deliver with the written NIE is temporary, the NIE number is everlasting in your whole life, so it can be used to compile all the forms from now on.

-**Empadronamiento**: This is a certificate delivered by your city hall (Ayuntamiento). Look for the Oficina de Atencion al Ciudadano.
Warning, Madrid (Comunidad de Madrid) is also a region but it is a different administration.
They have similar offices, but they can’t help you.   
**UPDATE COVID-19**: In Madrid you have to ask for an appointment, you can do it online.
This certificate recognizes officially that your address is yours.
If you get one with a temporary address, you will need to redo this step (and the following) when you have a permanent one.
Bring a copy of your passport, your rental contract (or substitute), and your work pre-contract. If these documents do not mention a stay of at-least 6 months in Madrid, you must provide one that does (e.g., a letter signed by your advisor at UAM).

-**Social Security Number**: With the empadronamiento, you can go to your local Oficina Tesoreria de la Seguridad Social, to get your social security number.  
**UPDATE COVID-19**: The Oficina Tesoreria de la Seguridad Social processeses everything online due to COVID-19 restriction without the need of providing them the Empadronamiento(!).
Since the time they process your request is highly variable, I strongly suggest to contact directly the Seccion de Contratación Personal Investigador at the UAM
and ask them to process the request of the social security number. In my experience it was quite effective and I obtained it in few days.
Through the request of the social security number, you will be registered in the system, but not yet effectively covered (see the section After the contract).
Your NIE and social security numbers will be linked already.

-**Bank account**: With your pre-contract, go to Plaza Mayor at the UAM or to any bank you are comfortable with and open a bank account (it is a standard procedure).
Indeed, the university needs to put the salary on a Spanish account.  
**UPDATE COVID-19**: most of the banks now receive through reservation during few hours each day. To reserve an appointment you need the temporary NIE (NIE blanco).

-**Contract**: You are almost there, the human resources in the Rectorado building need your NIE and social security numbers,
copy of latest academic degree, bank account number and information form.


## After the contract
Now that the contract is finalized and you are actually getting paid, you are almost out of the maze.

-**With your permanent address**: If you did the previous steps (starting from empadronamiento) with a temporary address,
you need to get back to doing the empadronamiento, social security, NIE and bank account with your permanent address.

-**With the NIE**: If you opened a bank account without your NIE (probably no longer possible), go back to Plaza Mayor and update your contract.
Same thing for Social Security. If you follow the instructions above, this step will not be needed.

-**Social security**: Go to the nearest health center (it should be the one you are affiliated with, now that you have a permanent address),
bring along your social security number and a certificate given to you by the university once the contract has been signed.
You will get your social security card and be effectively covered. If you brought your family with you, this is when they will enter the system.

-**UAM account**: To get official access to the university services, within a few days of your contract you should get a UAM account,
that comes with a mail address and intranet access. With it you will be able to ask for a permanent IP address at the servicio de atencion al usuario,
which is next to the Politecnica building. Meanwhile, ask Stefan Bilan (the IT guy for the department) for a temporary one.

-**Miscellaneous**: Don’t forget to get an insurance if you own a flat (this is mandatory in Spain).

**Good luck, and keep steady!**
