Here a short overview of the process you should follow if you want to hire
someone at UAM with funding from a project.

1. Fill out the "SOLICITUD DE CONTRATACIÓN LABORAL CON CARGO A PROYECTOS DE
   INVESTIGACIÓN" (it is attached below). Some notes about the contents:
   - You have to know the (clave) "Orgánica" of your project, which is an
     internal number at UAM, e.g. of the form 10.01.05.0096. If you don't know
     it, you should be able to check it on plataformadeinvestigacion.uam.es
     (which also contains other details about your projects, such as the
     expenses already covered by it etc).  
   - You have to include two other people as members of the "tribunal" that will
     choose the candidate. Even if only a single candidate applies, the tribunal
     will have to meet (most likely in Teams) and agree on the selection.
   - In this form, you also have to give (in "MÉRITOS A VALORAR") the selection
     criteria that will be used to decide between candidates, so make sure to
     choose them so that you will be able to select the most appropiate
     candidate. 
   
   Having filled the form, send it to <convocatorias.pi@uam.es> (".pi" is
   "personal investigador"). If you want the position announcement to be open
   for more than ten days after being posted, or if you might want to hire more
   than one person applying to the same announcement, you should mention it in
   the mail as well.
   
2. The administration will check that there is enough money left in the project
   and that the dates are compatible etc, and send it back to you with the
   calculated costs. You then have to sign the form and return it again.

3. After a while, the contract will be announced on the UAM website at
   https://www.uam.es/uam/investigacion/ofertas-empleo. If you're lucky, you
   will get a mail when this happens, but there is no guarantee.

4. The candidates have to apply following the instructions in the announcement
   (submitting a CV and filling out a form with personal data). The application
   can now fortunately be done through a webpage of UAM (before it had to be
   submitted at a "registro" of the Spanish state, which was non-trivial to do
   for applicants from outside Spain).

5. The offer will be open for around 10 days. A few days after the application
   deadline, a "lista provisional de candidatos" (provisional candidate list)
   will be published on the announcement page. This shows the names of all
   people who have successfully submitted their application, so if you know of
   any particular candidates who should have applied, it's a good idea to check
   that they are there (or tell them that they should check). AFAIK, neither you
   nor the candidates get notified when this list is published, so you have to
   be alert (or set reminders to check periodically). After publications of the
   list, there are five days to raise any potential problems (e.g., if the name
   of a candidate who applied is missing).

6. The administration will send you the list of candidates who have applied and
   their application materials, and contact you to find a date for the tribunal
   to meet (online) and decide on who will be chosen. One member of the
   personnel office will be in the tribunal and explain the procedure if there
   are any questions. Note that if there are no suitable candidates, it is
   possible to not fill the position (i.e., you are not forced to take an
   unsuitable candidate).

7. Once this is done, the official selection will be published (some days after
   the meeting) on the application webpage, and the personnel office
   (<seccionpi@uam.es>) will contact you to prepare the contract. In order to
   prepare the final contract, they need a DNI/NIE and social security number,
   as well as a Spanish bank account. If the selected candidate is Spanish, this
   is no problem, otherwise it depends on if they are from the EU or outside it.
   For people from EU member states, the administration can prepare a
   "precontract" (which helps with finding an apartment etc) and the candidate
   can get everything once they arrive in Spain (see the other document for
   details on this). If they are from outside the EU, they will need to first
   obtain a work permit (this is handled in Spain), and then a visa (in the
   Spanish embassy in their home country). This is a relatively long process
   (about two months). In order to learn the details, contact the international
   office (<acogida.internacional@uam.es>). Obtaining the work permit also
   requires a precontract, so it is a good idea to ask for that as soon as the
   selection process is finished.
