# UAM README

This repository collects relevant information for new PhD
students/postdocs/group leaders at the [Universidad Aut√≥noma de
Madrid](https://www.uam.es). Most of the information is in the
[wiki](../../wiki), with the main repository just containing some forms etc.

Note that this is not an official resource of UAM, but just information
collected over time by members of our group (https://mmuscles.eu).
